# Youtube-Clone
This project is a YouTube look-alike, built using just HTML and CSS. It's designed to work well on different screen sizes. I used CSS Grid to arrange the main video layout and Flexbox to neatly organize items in the header, video details, and sidebar. It shows my understanding of how to build user-friendly web interfaces.
